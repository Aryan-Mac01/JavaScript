<!-----------MAKE DOM AS SIMPLE AS YOU CAN--------------->
<!-----------Keeping that in mind we will consider DOM as normal documents  -------------->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--DOM starts from here and then goes to head and body-->
<head><!--Head and body are the sub sections of the DOM and the elements that comes in head and body are further divided into sub-sections forming a chart type structure-->
    <title>DOM</title><!--This title is the further sub section of the Head (DOM -> Head -> Title)-->
</head>
<body>
    <div class="nav"></div>
    <div class="body"><h1>Aryan mishra</h1></div>
    <div class="footer"></div> <!--The body also follows the same structure and together make a DOM Tree like structure-->
</body>
</html>
